## Zuri's Placement Frontend Test

For this frontend test, I chose **Beauty Clinic** as the small industry, and built an Astro template site for it. The name of this particular imagined beauty clinic is **Beleza** <span>&mdash;</span> spanish word for `beauty`, hence the name of this website.

[Here's the demo](https://beauty-clinic-beleza.vercel.app/)
